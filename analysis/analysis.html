              <p>We choose one typical day from three years to visualize the spatial distribution and changes of covid cases. From the map, we could see that the covid cases are greater in inner London in 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. Especially the Kensington and Chelsea borough has the highest total covid cases on a typical day in 2020. However, the high covid cases show a tendency to spread outward. In 2021, Borough Newham which has significant problems with poverty and inequality and borough Redbridge experienced higher total covid cases than any other boroughs. In 2022, Barnet with the largest population, Ealing, Wandsworth, and Croydon suffered from the greater cumulative covid cases while the total cases in Newham and Redbridge also remaine</p>

              <p>Different variations in the use of different modes of transport also occurred during COVID-19. After the first lock down, all transport modes except the bicycle showed a clear downward trend, while the bicycle showed a clear upward trend. This is probably due to the fear of the epidemic and the announcement of the lock down policy, which led to a reduction in unnecessary commuting and the choice of transport with less contact with others. During the closure period, parks open to the public have also become an option for people to exercise by bicycle. As policies and measures for COVID-19 gradually increase and Londoners return to their pre-epidemic state, the use of bicycles gradually re-emerges as a different option for citizens along with other modes of transport.</p>

            <p>In 2020/21 there was an increase in the share of cycling duration associated with private transport trips (increasing from 0 percent to 3 percent) and also as part of walking trips (O percent to 11 percent) meaning that although the majority of cycling duration was still done as cycle all the way trips, the proportion decreased from 98 percent in 2019/20 to 84 percent in 2020/21. </p>
            <p>The figure shows that the purposes for which London residents cycled have changed as a result of the pandemic. The share of cycling duration associated with commuting trips decreased from just less than half (45 percent) to 29 percent and for other work-related trips, it decreased from 14 percent to just 3 percent. The pattern is also the same as walking for shopping or personal business and leisure trips, which both saw an increase in the share of cycling duration (from 7 percent to 19 percent for shopping/personal business and from 26 percent to 42 percent for leisure). Showing that the reduction in commuter cycling as a result of workplace restrictions has been compensated by an increase in home-based leisure trips (a "purpose shift').</p>

    		<p>According to the first figure, there was a significant peak flow month from June to September,  as well as a significant duration peak from May to August, which indicates that many people prefer to choose biking in the summertime instead of other seasons, with some seasonal features. While in the first figure, we can see after the COVID pandemic, the green line shows over the red one, most of the blue one was the beneath, which means during the post-pandemic period, people prefer to bike, it shifted a daily ‘custom’.
    From the second figure, the strange peak in 2020-2021 May was significant, which was close to the first outburst of COVID-19. Also, we can see with the year growing, the green line(2021) shows higher above, which indicates people use bikes longer than before, they try to take bikes experiencing the long-distance trip.

            <p>As the Lockdown measures legally come into force in March 2020 and the ‘Stay at home’ order ends in March 2021, we choose one day at the beginning of April as our typical date to represent these three years to reflect the situation of public cycling usage before the pandemic (2019), during the pandemic and lockdown (2020) and post lockdown (2021).</p>
            <p>The public cycle usage has shown a similar trend for the typical day in 2019 and 2021. During the day, they follow a Multimodal distribution, and two peaks fit exactly with the morning rush hours from 7:00 to 9:00 and afternoon rush hours from 16:00 to 18:00. It is because people will need to use bicycles as their transport mode to commute during these two rush hours. The flows in 2021 decreased to only half of the flows in 2019 in the morning peak time while it decreased only one-third in the afternoon peak time. </p>
            <p>And it is noticeable that in 2020, the number of rides decreases approximately by four-fifths for the morning rush hours and the high usage period is significantly different which only peaks around afternoon rush hour. The reason behind this pattern could be due to the lockdown measures that all people work from home which reduces the demand for the cycle as a tool for commuting in the morning. And cycling may become a physical activity for exercise and recreation after dinner which could partly explain why it still peaks from 16:00 to 18:00.</p>

          <div class="content" id="content7">
            <p>Except for the daily flows, we are also curious about the total duration of cycle usage. From the picture, the total usage time of the public cycle still follows the same pattern of the flow count with two peaks at rush hour in 2019 and 2021 while only peaks around afternoon rush hour in 2020.
              <p>In addition, bicycle travel time during morning peak hours has also been reduced to about half of the pre-pandemic total in 2019. However, the difference is that the total riding time in the afternoon peak hours in 2020 has exceeded that in both 2019 and 2021, which may be because according to the lockdown policies, non-essential contact and travel are restricted while parks are opened for outdoor walking and cycling. The possibility that citizens choose cycling as an outdoor activity to exercise and stay physical fitness helps explain the much larger increase in cycling from 16:00 to 18:00 during the pandemic period compared to before the pandemic. </p>

          <div class="subheading"><p>Mean cycle changed flow on weekday and weekend in three years</p></div>
          <div class="content" id="content7">
            <p>Considering the usage of cycling will be different on the weekday and w
      eekends, we choose a typical week in three years to visualize the various distributions. The flows and durations for the weekday are summed up and divided by five days to get the mean value that represents a typical weekday. The flows and durations for the weekend are summed up and divided by two days to get the mean value that reflects a typical weekend.</p>
    <p>From the picture, the weekend flow shows a significantly different pattern than the weekday. The rush hour peaks are still prominent on the weekend which increases fast between lunch and dinner time, from 12:00 to 17:00, while the peak travel time on weekdays is during commute time. And journeys on weekend shows that the highest number of flows happened in 2020 and then 2021, suggesting the increasing demand for cycling during and post the pandemic. The number of weekend travels in 2020 is more than twice that of 2019. This may be because cycling become a popular mode of transportation for urban travel to avoid being infected throughout the epidemic. Therefore, we predict it could also play a critical part in post-epidemic urban transportation since people may get customed to using cycles.</p>

          <div class="content" id="content7">
        <p>Again, the daily time of trips on weekdays and weekends follows the same pattern as the number of trips on weekdays and weekends respectively. However, the peak riding time on weekday afternoon rush hours in 2020 topped that of 2019, setting a new record. And the size of the cycle journey duration is larger on weekends than on weekdays since the highest total riding hours during peak time on weekends is 15 million minutes compared to only 5 million minutes on weekdays. In addition, the Peak riding hours on weekend in 2020 is more than five times higher than in pre-pandemic 2019, which further indicates the increasing demand and usage of the public cycle during the pandemic time. </p>

              <p>Regression analysis was implemented to examine whether the number of COVID-19 infections had an effect on people's choice of bicycle trips, and all the variables are normalized in the same range to compare the independent variable impact through coefficient.

    both increased in the covid-19 period. So it could be supposed that other factors

              <p>As the use of bicycles becomes more common, parking facilities should be managed. Parking infrastructure includes cycle racks on the pavement, which can be sheltered or uncovered; protected stations to prevent theft and infractions; and cycle lockers, usually located at public transport stops.
